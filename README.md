Python Project proposal: Weather Checker Application

Project Overview

Your primary objective is to create a text-based Python colab notebook that can fetch and display weather data for any specified location.
This project will bolster your understanding of Python's core concepts and introduce you to JSON structures and RESTful APIs.
Here's how to get started:
Core Functionality Instructions

Objective: Build a weather data fetching application in a Google Colab notebook.
Setup:
Start with a new Google Colab notebook for an easy-to-use Python environment.
API Integration:
Sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Familiarize yourself with the API's endpoints, request URLs, and JSON response format.
Application Development:
Write code in the Colab notebook that asks for a city name input.
Use the requests library to make API calls and retrieve weather data.
Extract and display relevant data such as temperature, weather conditions, and humidity.
